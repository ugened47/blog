## What is Flex

If you are here, you probably already know what Sharetribe Flex is.
However, for those who don't - it's a powerful SaaS solution that helps people rapidly prototype, validate and release their marketplaces.
Flex is a headless API-first marketplace platform that does not restrict you in your ideas. Any kind of marketplace can be built either your members provide services or sell products on your site.
Check out awesome [Docs](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/) for more information and a better understanding of Sharetribe Flex.

Every flex marketplace consists of the front-end application and the API provided by Sharetribe, so coding knowledge is required if you'd like to provide customization.
Luckily for us, the Sharetribe team has already built a few open-source templates for different purposes.

- [FTW-daily](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-daily) - rental marketplace with day-based bookings
- [FTW-hourly](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-hourly) - service marketplace with time-based bookings
- [FTW-product](https://github.com/sharetribe/ftw-product) - product marketplace with stock management

All templates are created using React.js and a tiny Express.js server which is used for server-side rendering and some other purposes.

I'm starting a series of articles to help new marketplace developers understand how to properly extend FTW templates and implement common missing features.

The first topic I'd like to cover is the development

## Development using Docker

In the past years [Docker](https://docker.io) became an industry standard and now helps millions of people to build and ship their applications.

At this stage, we will get our hands dirty by cloning a fresh copy of the flex template.

`git clone git@github.com:sharetribe/ftw-product.git`

`cd ftw-product`

`cp .env-template .env`

Get yourself [mandatory configuration keys](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/introduction/getting-started-with-ftw-daily/#mandatory-integrations) and add them to your `.env` file.

To containerize your app we'll create these two files:

`touch Dockerfile.dev docker-compose.yml`

Add the following content to `Dockerfile.dev`

```Dockerfile
# Use LTS version of node to build the container
FROM node:lts-alpine

# Creates working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app
COPY yarn.lock /app

# Installs dependencies inside the container
RUN yarn

# Copy rest of files to the container working directory
COPY . /app

# Internal port to listen to
EXPOSE 3000

# Execute main command
CMD ["yarn", "dev"]
```

I will not pay a lot of attention to what is happening here as there is a lot of information about docker on the web which can describe much better than me.
However, I've added some comments to the definitions in Dockerfile which are also known as `layers`.

In the next step, we have to define how to run the Dockerfile and make our app up and running. There are multiple ways of doing that.
We can run a container using CLI but I prefer using docker-compose to manage services in development.
So let's start with opening `docker-compose.yml` and adding the following content to it.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  web:
    container_name: ftw-product-dev
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
      - '/app/node_modules'
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Here we define the service called `web` which is responsible for running our containerized application. `Ports` section defines the mapping between host and container as well as `volumes`.
If we don't map volumes the changes in files on the host won't be reflected in the container and you'll always have to rebuild an image to see every single change, a really bad dev experience.

At this stage, we're almost done we only have to build and run our up using `docker compose build && docker compose up -d`.
The process might take a few minutes and after it's finished open `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the landing page of your brand new marketplace.
Change something in the code and changes will be reflected in the browser thanks to HMR.

So that's it for today! I hope this article will be useful for those who plan to start working with flex.

There are a lot more to come on this and other topics in the future so stay tuned as in the next series I'm going to discover nice-to-have things in flex like background processing, third-party payments, real-time messages, and a lot more.
